# 🌾 Project Overview:
Agricultural producer price—also known as farm-gate price refers to the price that farmers receive for selling their agricultural products at the point of production, typically before the products enter the broader market chain. This price excludes costs related to transportation, marketing, storage, and retail. It represents the actual income a farmer earns per unit of crop or livestock sold. 

These prices are a key economic indicator, influencing farm profitability, food security, and national agricultural planning. It’s a direct indicator of farm income. 

Forecasting producer prices is important because it empowers farmers to make informed production and marketing decisions, supports policymakers in designing effective interventions, and helps stabilize markets. Reliable forecasts also aid in managing food supply chains and guiding investments in the agricultural sector.

However, forecasting these prices is challenging due to the complex, interdependent, and often non-linear nature of the influencing factors. These include economic trends, climate variability, input costs, trade policies, and socio-political dynamics—many of which vary across crops, countries, and time periods.

**In this project, we aim to forecast agricultural producer prices using multi-dimensional datasets from FAOSTAT, leveraging information on economic, environmental, geographic, input-related, and policy factors.**

We explore key questions such as:

- What are the most influential factors driving agricultural producer price trends?

- How accurately can these prices be forecasted across different regions and crop types?

The intended audience includes farmers, farm managers, agricultural scientists, economists, and policymakers. By generating forward-looking insights, this project aims to improve decision-making at the farm and policy levels, enhance market resilience, and support strategic planning in the agricultural sector.
